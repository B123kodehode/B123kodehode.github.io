    <p> <span style="color:rgb(127, 255, 212)">Who am I?</span>  My name is Benjamin, and I am currently studying Frontend development. I have completed the HTML, CSS, Javascript, Figma and SQL modules, and have just finished both Express and MongoDB. Though I will have to admit that I'd much rather be studying Backend instead, since I find staring at colour gradients and aligning content on websites with flexbox and grid for 8 hours a day to be incredibly boring.</p>
    <br> <br>
    <p><span style="color:rgb(127, 255, 212)">My current education:</span> After a few years, I decided to take a few different courses in "Digital Security" and "MS Azure",  in addition to spending some time studying MS 365 independently,  in addition to studying for the MS Azure Administrator certificate as soon as my Frontend course reaches its conclusion.</p> 
    <br> <br>
    <p> <span style="color:rgb(127, 255, 212)">My work experience:</span> So, where have i been working previously? Well...I have previously worked as an IT apprentice for 3.5 years at Vardafjell VGS and at a Local Support position at Aibel for over 8 years, where I found myself craving more of a challenge and a variety of tasks. So, here I am.

    <p><span style="color:aquamarine">My hobbies and personal opinions</span> consist of cycling, reading webnovels and spending as much time during summer as possible driving around on my motorcycle. Also, I greatly enjoy participating, once a year, in the annually organized "Skjold på Tvers", "Haugesund på kryss og tvers", and "7 fjells-turen in Bergen". I also enjoy reading up on IT security, staying far away from all social media and free globalized providers of services, such as Microsoft, Google, Facebook and so on. Minimizing my digital footprint as much as possible, is something I consider highly important in our day and age. It is a pity that this is a priority not commonly shared among IT employees around the globe, unless it's the IT security at their jobs. I find privacy and your right to govern it just as important as IT security at your workplace. Shame barely anyone agrees.
