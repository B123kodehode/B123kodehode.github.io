    <h1>Hello, this is my new portefolio</h1>
    <br>
    <h4><p>About me:</p></h4>
    <p>Hello, my name is Benjamin, and I am currently studying Frontend development. I have so far completed the HTML, CSS, Javascript and SQL modul, and am currently studying both Express and MongoDB which I find most interesting.
    <br>  <br> <br> 
    Even though I will have to admit that I'd much rather be studying Backend instead, since I find staring at colour gradients and aligning content on websites with flexbox and grid for 8 hours a day is most horrendous.
    <br>  <br> <br> 
    So, where have i been working previously? Well...I have previously worked as an IT apprentice for 3.5 years at Vardafjell VGS and at a Local Support position at Aibel for over 8 years, where I found myself creaving more of a challenge and variety of tasks. So, here I am.
    <br>  <br> <br>
    After a few years I decided to take a few various courses in "Digital Security" and "MS Azure",  in addition to spending some time studying MS 365 independently,  in addition to studying for the MS Azure Administrator certificate as soon as my Frontend course reaches its conclusion.
    <br>  <br> <br>
    My hobbies consist of biking, reading webnovels and spending as much time during summer as possible driving around on my motorcycle. Also, I greatly enjoy participating once a year, on the annnually organized "Skjold på Tvers", "Haugesund på kryss og tvers", and "7 fjells-turen in Bergen".
    <br>
    I also enjoy reading up on IT security, staying far away from all social media and free globalized providers of services, such as Microsoft, Google, Facebook and so on. Minimizing my digital footprint as much as possible, is something I consider as highly important in our day and age. A pity that this is a priority not commonly shared among IT employees around the globe, unless it's the IT security at their jobs. I find privacy and your right to govern it just as important as the IT security at your workplace. Shame no one agrees.
