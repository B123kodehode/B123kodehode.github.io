    <h4>About myself:</h4>
    <br><br> <br><br>
    <p id="myself"><span style="color:aquamarine">My hobbies and personal opinions</span> consist of cycling, reading webnovels and spending as much time during summer as possible driving around on my motorcycle. Also, I greatly enjoy participating, once a year, in the annually organized "Skjold på Tvers", "Haugesund på kryss og tvers", and "7 fjells-turen i Bergen". I also enjoy reading up on IT security, staying far away from all social media and free globalized providers of services, such as Microsoft, Google, Facebook and so on. Minimizing my digital footprint as much as possible, is something I consider highly important in our day and age. I find privacy and your right to govern it just as important as IT security at work.
